# OpenMVG-MVS-Tools

These scripts depend on the complete build in linux/Ubuntu ( I use 14.04 ) of the following, including all dependencies:
[OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/)
[OpenMVS](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/)

Huge kudos and credit to the developers behind these incredible projects.

## BASH shell scripts to automate the processing for building SfM data sets using OpenMVG and OpenMVS

These scripts essentially are my way of automating OpenMVG/OpenMVS toolsets to start from a folder of images and end with all the modelling outputs that the software provides. 

It was a quick way for me to learn how to configure/setup variables in the process and see the effects on the output.

Remember to rename "out" directory after each run, if data is present in consecutive runs, the programs sometimes use the output and skip steps.
